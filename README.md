# Aerodrome Management System

## ðŸš€ About the Project
This project was developed during my Bachelor's degree to learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a **Windows Forms application** that simulates an **aerodrome management system**. The main features include:

- Creating **passengers**
- Allowing passengers to **purchase tickets**
- Managing **flights and routes**

The project focuses on implementing the four fundamental principles of OOP:
- **Encapsulation** - Protecting internal object states and exposing only necessary data.
- **Abstraction** - Simplifying complex systems by defining high-level structures.
- **Inheritance** - Allowing classes to inherit behavior from base classes.
- **Polymorphism** - Enabling different classes to be treated through a common interface.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **C#** - Main programming language
- **Windows Forms** - UI framework for desktop applications
- **.NET Framework** - Core runtime environment

## âœ¨ Features
- **Passenger Management** - Create, edit, and delete passengers.
- **Flight Booking** - Passengers can purchase tickets for available flights.
- **Route System** - Flights have predefined routes connecting different locations.
